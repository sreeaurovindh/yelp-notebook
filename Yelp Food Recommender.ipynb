    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp is the collection of reviews crowd-sourced by vari-ous users and has become a key product when custom-ers tend to make their restaurant choices. Each customer writes their reviews based on the various      experience they face during their visit to the restaurant. Customer’s choice of the restaurant can depend on a   variety of fac-tors like the name of the food item, quality of the food item, and the variety of other restaurant attributes like location, cost, and service. In addition, business owners would also like to prioritize on which items to improve and what attributes of the restaurant should be improved based on the reviews.\n",

The Query engine takes the Wikipedia pairs (cuisine, food item) and queries each food item and makes a full-text search on the Solr index. This returns the set of re-views for each food item. Now the sentence containing the food item is extracted out and is stored as a JSON file.\n",

    "A very simple way to describe this process is to identify nouns in the sentence and then look for nearest adjec-tives around it. There are obvious shortcomings of the above approach and are overcome by extracting syntac-tic      dependencies between words and output word forms by the Stanford CoreNLP tool. We used open source libraries that use Stanford’s tool to extract vari-ous noun and the adjective pairs and these pairs are stored in JSON. These pairs of data are called Attribute Pairs. For example, some of the attribute pairs include (corn, sweet), (ambiance, horrible). The overall natural language processing time for the extraction of 2.5 GB of data was high. Hence we used an optimized amazon EC2 Linux cluster machines to parallelize this process and the resultant   output was collected back to a single machine.\n",

    "The visual recommender system provides insights about the yelp data to both the business owners and the         customers for taking informed decisions. The system   provides recommendations for the selected user with the help of interactive dashboard which uses a com-bined dataset from Yelp and Wikipedia. Here, we have tried to provide answers to the four questions after ana-lyzing the data.\n",

    "The sentiment analysis implemented on the reviews have provided the system with more insight into the reviews than the normal unprocessed rating. Through this, the system could consolidate and inter-relate all the graphs with respect to both the business user and the customers. The system predominantly uses four graphs to visualize the questions. The initial graph pro-vides a selection guide to various facets based on the distribution of the items inside each category. The food quality over time intensity maps provide us with an overall view of the customer’s change in food quality perception over time. This is      further extended to show the food item quality           comparison and attrib-ute opinion comparison. Finally, the system recom-mends the customer with a list of      restaurants based on their friends’ preferences which are well connected with a concept map."
